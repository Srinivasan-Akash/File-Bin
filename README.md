# File Bin
A basic project in next.js and supabase where people can upload their files with phone number and can get a shareable link. Which they can share to thier friends who can further scan for viruses in the browser itself and download those files. ALso my webapp g-zip's & un-zip's during upload and download
***NOTE That I need To develop OTP and Scan for Viruses Functionality***
